This is a simple implementation of a Vector class in C++. It includes the following functionalities:

- Constructor: creates a vector of a given dimension and initializes all its components to zero, or to a given value.
- Destructor: frees the memory used by the vector.
- Method AfficheVecteur(): prints the components of the vector.
- Method ComposerVecteur(): prompts the user to enter the components of the vector.
- Overloaded operator []: allows access to the components of the vector.
- Overloaded operator =: assigns the components of one vector to another.
- Overloaded operator +=: adds the components of one vector to another.
